# These are placeholder files for sound effects
# In a real implementation, you would add actual .wav or .mp3 files here

# move.wav - Sound when moving a piece
# capture.wav - Sound when capturing a piece

# You can download free chess sound effects from:
# - freesound.org
# - zapsplat.com
# - Adobe Stock Audio

# Or record your own sounds for a unique experience
